            <div class="poem-text">
                I loved you<br>
                without a promise,<br>
                without a future,<br>
                without my name beside yours.<br><br>

                Not to compete,<br>
                not to steal,<br>
                not to beg the universe to rewrite your story —<br>
                but to love you quietly<br>
                from the corner where unchosen hearts sit.<br><br>

                I know I hurt you sometimes.<br>
                My impatience,<br>
                my fear of losing you,<br>
                my desperate hands trying to hold<br>
                what was never mine to hold.<br><br>

                And for that,<br>
                I carry regret like a shadow.<br><br>

                You may never walk toward me.<br>
                You may never look back.<br><br>

                You may build your forever<br>
                with someone braver, better, steadier.<br><br>

                And I —<br>
                I may fail a thousand times<br>
                trying to become worthy in your memory.<br><br>

                But one day,<br>
                even if I am just a passing thought,<br>
                I hope you remember me<br>
                not as the boy who wanted too much,<br><br>

                but as the one<br>
                who loved you<br>
                without conditions,<br>
                without ownership,<br>
                without expecting to win.<br><br>

                Even if I was never your choice,<br>
                I will grow.<br>
                I will rise.<br>
                I will become someone<br>
                who no longer loves from lack,<br>
                but from strength.<br><br>

                And maybe,<br>
                from somewhere far away,<br>
                you will hear of me<br>
                and smile —<br><br>

                knowing<br>
                that once,<br>
                someone loved you<br>
                so deeply<br>
                he chose to become better<br>
                instead of bitter.<br><br>

                Even if not yours.<br>
                Even if not mine.
